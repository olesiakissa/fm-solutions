## My process
### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties, Flexbox, Grid
- jQuery

### What I learned

:arrow_right: In this project I learned how to create and position popups.

:arrow_right: I also learned how to create sharing functionality.

:arrow_right: The main difficulties were:
  - <i>creating the logic of opening and closing the modal window based on screen size</i>
  - <i>creating the correct flow for the screen reader when it comes to buttons (I used ChromeVox Screen Reader for testing things out)</i>

### Continued development

:bulb: I think that this project can be improved by adding open graph meta tags which help to organize content during sharing process (e.g. this will help to add images to the article during sharing to Twitter or Pinterest).

:bulb: It would be nice to implement the centering of share dialog in desktop version.
