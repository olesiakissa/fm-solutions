## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- VanillaJS

### What I learned

:arrow_right: In this project I learned how to create collapsibles that allow to open only one section at a time. 

:arrow_right: I also had a lot of fun with the positioning of elements and animations.

### Continued development

:fast_forward: I think that this component can be improved by
  - creating dark theme
  - making button & link elements more accessible by editing :focus attributes
  - changing the display logic of illustration to get rid of hardcoded positioning
